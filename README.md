using machine learning to estimate the impact of Malaria

## Background

<ceneter><img src="/images/Picture1.png" alt="World View"></center>

Malaria, though rare in the USA (most cases present in recent travelers), is still a prevailing
pestilence that claims hundreds of thousands of lives across the world. The WHO estimates that in
2015 there were 214 million new cases of malaria resulting in 438,000 deaths. Geographically 40% of
the worldâ€™s population lives in regions with a risk of malaria. From an economic perspective malaria
costs Africa alone an estimated $12 billion per year in GDP. This is all in the backdrop of modern
public health and medical science having the ability to greatly curtail this impact as we have done in
many areas already but despite efforts of many organizations we have failed to do so to any degree
of completeness. 


## Data

From various sources such as WHO and World Bank. 

## Methodology

Use of ML models to estimate the incidence of malaria in a given region based on environmental, demographic, and cultural factors.

## Conclusion
The modeling prooved to be moderatly effective. Though the process was complicated by messy and possibly inaccurate data. As this is a well known problem with Malaria data we must work with that we have. I believe that with sufficient data e.g. across enough years, and access to additional data features e.g. humidita at a usable resolution it would be very feasible to build a model to predict the impact of malaria inm a given region and be able to position relief efforts accordingly.
